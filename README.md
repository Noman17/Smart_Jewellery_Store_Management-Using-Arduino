# SmartJewelleryStoreManagement
In this project I made a smart jewellery store management system. The owner of the store enters the store using a password. The password is "8014". If the owner enters the wrong 
password, print “Wrong password!” for the first 2 times on the LCD display, on the 3rd time, print “Intruder Alert!” and turn on the buzzer alarm. The buzzer is only turned off 
if the correct password is typed in. The entry door is automated. If the correct password is input, the door is opened 120°, then automatically closes 30 seconds later. LED 
Lights(5 lights in total) and fan motors(3 motors in total) in the store gets turned on automatically as soon as motion is detected or when someone enters using the password. 
Sensitive jewellery is kept in temperature-monitored cases. An LCD display shows the temperature. If the temperature is within 8° to 58° celsius, a fan motor inside the case is 
turned on. If it goes below 8°, the fan motor is turned off. If the temperature is above 58° celsius, the fan motor inside the case is turned on and also a buzzer goes off, 
alerting the storekeepers.
